                Hi, glad you made it to my page. My name is Zach Garcia (my friends just call me "Z", haha). I'm a 26
                year-old born and raised in Chicago, currently living in Uptown in the same city. In 2015 I graduated
                from Loyola University with a B.S. in Environmental Science. Soon after, I moved to Malta to get my
                Master's degrees in Environmental Management & Sustainability and Integrated Science & Technology. It
                was really hot on that island! Unofortunately, after sometime working in my field I became
                disheartened. Many of my co-workers and employers were very dispassionate and dis-interested in the
                work we were doing, and I felt as though my contributions were of no consequence. Thus, I decided to
                change career paths and I'm now enrolled in Northwestern's coding bootcamp baby!
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">

                Enough of all that education mumbo jumbo, I'm sure you'd rather hear more about the real Z! In my spare
                time I like to read informational books, from books about dark matter to body language. I also dabble
                in the 'ol six string when I have some down time at the crib. I'm a big fan of horror movies, comedy
                shows, board games, ultimate firsbee, and the out doors (This sure feels like I'm writing an about me
                section for a dating site)! I've worked a ton of odd jobs, from knife salesman, to biodeisel lab
                technitian, all the way to pedi-cabber (That's a picture of me pedi-cabbing in what is hopefully the
                top left section of this page!)
